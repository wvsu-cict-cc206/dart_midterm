## Midterm Output

Papel, Gunting, Bato! Using Dart as the programming language, create a classic Filipino game by entering values in the command line.

The program (bot) should ask:
```
Papel, Gunting, Bato! What's your Pick? 
```

The user inputs a keyword or value:
```
Bato 
```

The bot picks a random choice then prints the output:
```
Bot: Gunting - You Win!
```

### Other Notes

* Reuse and building upon ideas or code are major parts of modern software development. As a professional programmer you will never write anything from scratch. This class is structured such that all solutions are public. You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers. I won't hunt down people who are simply copying-and-pasting solutions, because without challenging themselves, they are simply wasting their time taking this class.
* Making a flow diagram before coding will help you a lot.
* Be creative! You can innovate and formulate better user interactions, solutions or program outputs.
